# Platform Base Client

The OpenZeppelin Platform provides a security operations (SecOps) platform for Ethereum with built-in best practices. Development teams implement the Platform to ship faster and minimize security risks.

Certain components of the Platform, such as Monitors or Relay, can be interacted with programmatically via an API. This library provides the base class for the clients.
